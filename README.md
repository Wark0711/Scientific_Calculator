Hello, I have made a JS Scientific Calculator to perform mathematical calculations.
Buttons dispalyed in grey color means that you have to put the value first and then apply desired operations on that.
For example, if you want to claculate the reciprocal of a number, just type the value and click on reciprocal button to obtain the desired result.
If you make an error while calculating, don't worry. The calculator won't remove entire calculation.
It won't display a result. So simply correct the calculation.
